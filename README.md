## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had hired a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Learnt things from this Project 
- By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
- Tried using color palette and stick with that colors throughout the dashboard

## Some Important insights from the Dashboard

- Mumbai generates the highest revenue (660 M) followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi.
- property_id	"16559" AtliQ Exotica in mumbai performs better compared to all properties with 117 Million revenue, rating 4.3 , occupancy percentage 65.85 and cancellation rate as 24.63%.
- Property_ID "16563" AtliQ Palace in Delhi has the highest occupancy of 66.25%.
- Week 26 recorded the Lowest revenue among all, which is 114.15 Million.
- On Weekdays and Weekends Delhi tops both in occupancy and rating followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore.
