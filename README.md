## Project Overview

AtliQ Grand is a renowned imaginary company with five-star hotels in major cities across India, including Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, and Bangalore. Despite its esteemed reputation, AtliQ Grand has experienced a decline in revenue and market share. To address this, the company sought assistance to analyze its data and provide actionable insights and recommendations.

In this project, I acted as the service provider, utilizing Power BI to analyze AtliQ Grand's data in detail and generate valuable insights.

## Key Learnings – Hospitality Domain

Through this project, I gained valuable domain knowledge in the hospitality industry and got familiar with several key performance metrics used in hotel operations. Here are some of the important concepts I learned:

- **RevPAR** (Revenue Per Available Room) – Measures how well a hotel fills its rooms at average rates.

- **ADR** (Average Daily Rate) – The average revenue earned per occupied room per day.

- **DSRN** (Daily Sellable Room Nights) – Total number of rooms available for sale each day.

- **DURN** (Daily Utilized Room Nights) – Number of rooms actually occupied by guests.

- **DBRN** (Daily Booked Room Nights) – Total number of rooms booked for a given day.

- **Occupancy%** – Percentage of available rooms that are occupied.

- **Realisation%** – Percentage of revenue actually earned compared to what was expected (after considering cancellations).

- **Average Lead Time** – The average number of days between the booking date and the check-in date.

- **Weekdays (Sunday to Thursday)** – Typically business-focused bookings.

- **Weekends (Friday and Saturday)** – More leisure-focused bookings.

- **cancellation policies** - Referring to the different cancellation policies followed by different hotels, it can be understood that most hotels charge a zero fee only if the booking is canceled before three months of the booking date. If the booking is canceled after that, the charge ranges from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
